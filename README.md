This is a web-based rock-paper-scissors game made from HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

In the first iteration of the software, the game can only be played initially from the console and will be improved from time to time.

For those who are not familiar with the game, this is the description from Wikipedia:
"Rock paper scissors (also known by several other names and word orders, see ยง Names) is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).
A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win, or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who chooses scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"[1]), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually replayed to break the tie."

The program will ask for the user input/prompt through console or UI then the second player (computer) will provide a randomized choice among rock, paper, and scissors.

I will also add a CHANGELOG.MD file to track the version releases, and to practice proper versioning.

Let's go!
